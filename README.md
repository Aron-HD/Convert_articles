# Convert Articles

A new development for automating the conversion of edited docx content to html and correctly named images. 

- **Goal:** direct cost savings for my company and reduced production time for web articles (case studys).
- We currently send this content to India and pay for a company to convert the files to html and extract all images. We then have to wait around a week for this to be completed before the article assets can be uploaded to our CMS and published as articles on our website.
